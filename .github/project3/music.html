        <h1>RENAISSANCE ACT 1</h1>
        <h3>Release date: July 29, 2022</h3>
      </div><img src="images/bey.renaissance.jpg" alt="renaissance">
      <p>Renaissance is such a joyous and celebratory album full of self-love and, most importantly DANCE! The album was heavily inspired by the ballroom scene, an underground LGBTQ+ (mainly by black transwomen) subculture originated by young African American and Latin American in New York City. Renaissance holds a heartfelt dedication to her beloved queer Uncle Johnny, who passed away. He introduced her to the vibrant culture and inspiring music that served as the foundation for this incredible album. In addition to showcasing a diverse array of sounds, the album pays homage to influential figures within the queer community. It incorporates elements and references from prominent individuals such as Big Freedia, TS Madison, Donna Summers, Honey Dijon, and Kevin Aviance. Beyoncé is an artist who is not afraid to experiment with music and constantly evolves her craft. Her artistic journey from her self-titled album to LEMONADE and now RENAISSANCE showcases remarkable growth. This album also has gained significant popularity despite not having any accompanying visuals.</p>
